## Focus: Filtering with NOT, IS NOT, and NULL

Today’s practice session is focused on **accurate and intentional SQL filtering**, with emphasis on handling exclusions and missing values using `NOT`, `IS NOT`, and `NULL`.

### Practice Method
- Copilot provides SQL prompts  
- I write the appropriate query using proper formatting and best practices  
- Immediate feedback is reviewed and incorporated  

### Goals
- Master correct handling of `NULL` vs non-`NULL` values  
- Avoid common filtering mistakes (`!= NULL`, incorrect negation logic)  
- Improve precision in business-driven WHERE clauses  
- Strengthen confidence with exclusion-based conditions
