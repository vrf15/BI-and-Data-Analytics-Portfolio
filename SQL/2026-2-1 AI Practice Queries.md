### Problem — 2026-02-01 — #1
**Description:**  
Count 2024 encounters by provider specialty using a 2‑CTE pipeline.

**Tables:**  
- Encounters  
- Providers  

**Columns:**  
**Encounters**  
- encounter_id  
- patient_id  
- provider_id  
- encounter_date  
- encounter_type  
- diagnosis_code  

**Providers**

### Problem — 2026-02-01 — #2
**Description:**  
Count abnormal 2024 lab results by patient gender using a 2‑CTE pipeline.

**Tables:**  
- LabResults  
- Patients  

**Columns:**  
**LabResults**  
- result_id  
- patient_id  
- test_name  
- result_value  
- result_flag  
- result_date  

**Patients**  
- patient_id  
- first_name  
- last_name  
- gender  
- date_of_birth  

**Requirements:**  
- CTE #1: Filter LabResults to abnormal 2024 results, keep patient_id + result_id  
- CTE #2: Join to Patients, group by gender, count abnormal results  
- Final: Return gender + abnormal_2024_count, order DESC  

---

**Final SQL Solution: My Response**  
```sql
WITH abnormal_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        result_flag,
        patient_id,
        result_id
    FROM LabResults
    WHERE
        result_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
        result_flag = 'Abnormal'
),
gender_counts AS (
    SELECT
        p.gender,
        COUNT(abnormal_2024) AS abnormal_2024_count
    FROM LabResults lr
    INNER JOIN Patients p
        ON  lr.patient_id = p.patient_id
    GROUP BY gender
)
SELECT
    p.gender,
    abnormal_2024_count
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Final SQL Solution: Correct Answer**  
```sql
WITH abnormal_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        patient_id,
        result_id
    FROM LabResults
    WHERE
        result_flag = 'Abnormal'
        AND result_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
),

gender_counts AS (
    SELECT
        p.gender,
        COUNT(a.result_id) AS abnormal_2024_count
    FROM abnormal_2024 a
    INNER JOIN Patients p
        ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
    GROUP BY p.gender
)

SELECT
    gender,
    abnormal_2024_count
FROM gender_counts
ORDER BY abnormal_2024_count DESC;
```

**Feedback**  
- Missing `AND` between WHERE conditions  
- CTE #1 included `result_flag` unnecessarily and didn’t filter correctly  
- CTE #2 didn’t use the CTE; it re‑queried LabResults  
- `COUNT(abnormal_2024)` is invalid — must count a column  
- Final SELECT referenced `p.gender` but `p` wasn’t in scope  
- ORDER BY used `count` instead of the alias  
- Correct structure: filter → join → aggregate → final select  

**Realization**

Oh, I get it now. I am supposed to count the first CTE rather than take the LabResults table.

Because they are joined at the end, I don't need to add the prefix

### Problem — 2026-02-01 — #3
**Description:**  
Sum 2024 completed medication order costs by drug class using a 2‑CTE pipeline.

**Tables:**  
- MedicationOrders  
- Medications  

**Columns:**  
**MedicationOrders**  
- order_id  
- patient_id  
- medication_id  
- order_date  
- order_status  
- cost  

**Medications**  
- medication_id  
- medication_name  
- drug_class  

**Requirements:**  
- CTE #1: Filter MedicationOrders to completed 2024 orders, keep medication_id + cost  
- CTE #2: Join to Medications, group by drug_class, sum cost  
- Final: Return drug_class + completed_2024_cost, order DESC  

---

**Final SQL Solution: My Response**  
```sql
WITH completed_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        medication_id,
        cost
    FROM MedicationOrders
    WHERE
        order_status = 'Completed'
        AND order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
)
class_costs AS (
    SELECT
        m.drug_class,
        SUM(c.cost) as completed_2024_cost
    FROM Medications m
    INNER JOIN completed_2024 c
        ON c.medication_id = m.medication_id
    GROUP BY drug_class
)
SELECT
    drug_class,
    completed_2024_cost
ORDER BY cost DESC;
```

**Final SQL Solution: Correct Answer**  
```sql
WITH completed_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        medication_id,
        cost
    FROM MedicationOrders
    WHERE
        order_status = 'Completed'
        AND order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
),

class_costs AS (
    SELECT
        m.drug_class,
        SUM(c.cost) AS completed_2024_cost
    FROM completed_2024 c
    INNER JOIN Medications m
        ON c.medication_id = m.medication_id
    GROUP BY m.drug_class
)

SELECT
    drug_class,
    completed_2024_cost
FROM class_costs
ORDER BY completed_2024_cost DESC;
```

**Feedback**  
- Missing comma between CTEs — you need a comma after the first CTE.  
- `GROUP BY drug_class` should be `GROUP BY m.drug_class` for clarity and correctness.  
- Final `ORDER BY cost DESC` is invalid — `cost` doesn’t exist in the final SELECT; must order by the alias `completed_2024_cost`.  
- Final SELECT must reference the second CTE (`class_costs`) explicitly.  
- Overall structure is correct — just needed syntactic tightening and proper ordering.

### Problem — 2026-02-01 — #4
**Description:**  
Sum 2024 completed radiology order costs by modality group using a 2‑CTE pipeline.

**Tables:**

- modality_id  
- order_date  
- order_status  
- cost  

**RadiologyTypes**  
- modality_id  
- modality_name  
- modality_group  

**Requirements:**  
- CTE #1: Filter RadiologyOrders to completed 2024 orders, keep modality_id + cost  
- CTE #2: Join to RadiologyTypes, group by modality_group, sum cost  
- Final: Return modality_group + completed_2024_cost, order DESC  

---

**Final SQL Solution: My Response**  
```sql
WITH completed_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        modality_id,
        cost
    FROM RadiologyOrders
    WHERE
        order_status = 'Completed'
        order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
),

group_costs AS (
    SELECT
        rt.modality_id,
        SUM(c.cost) AS completed_2024_costs
    FROM RadiologyTypes rt
    INNER JOIN completed_2024 c
        ON rt.modality_id = c.modality_id
    GROUP BY rt.modality_group

SELECT
    modality_group
    completed_2024_cost
ORDER BY cost DESC;
```

**Final SQL Solution: Correct Answer**  
```sql
WITH completed_2024 AS (
    SELECT
        modality_id,
        cost
    FROM RadiologyOrders
    WHERE
        order_status = 'Completed'
        AND order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
),

group_costs AS (
    SELECT
        rt.modality_group,
        SUM(c.cost) AS completed_2024_cost
    FROM completed_2024 c
    INNER JOIN RadiologyTypes rt
        ON c.modality_id = rt.modality_id
    GROUP BY rt.modality_group
)

SELECT
    modality_group,
    completed_2024_cost
FROM group_costs
ORDER BY completed_2024_cost DESC;
```

**Feedback**  
- Missing `AND` between WHERE conditions.  
- CTE #2 never closed — missing the closing parenthesis and comma.  
- You selected `rt.modality_id` but needed `rt.modality_group`.  
- Alias mismatch: you used `completed_2024_costs` but selected `completed_2024_cost` later.  
- Final SELECT was missing commas between columns.  
- Final ORDER BY referenced `cost`, which doesn’t exist — must order by the aggregated alias.  
- Overall structure is correct; just needed syntactic cleanup and correct grouping column.

    inpatient_2024_count
FROM type_counts
ORDER BY inpatient_2024_count DESC;
```

**Feedback**  
- Missing comma between CTEs — every CTE except the last must end with a comma.  
- CTE #2 was missing a closing parenthesis.  
- ORDER BY used the correct alias — good.  
- Logic was perfect; only structural syntax issues.
