# SQL Practice

SQL practice queries will be added to this folder.

## Practice Method
- AI-generated prompts are used instead of real database queries to strengthen recall, reinforce SQL structure, and get instant feedback on mistakes and improvements.
- As of **February 1, 2026**, **GitHub Copilot** is the primary AI tool used for training purposes.

## Goal
While most modern analysts use AI-assisted SQL in the workplace (and I plan to as well), my goal is to build **full mastery of SQL fundamentals and functions** so I can write accurate, readable queries **with or without AI**.

We can draw this comparison to knowing basic arithmetic versus using a calculator!
