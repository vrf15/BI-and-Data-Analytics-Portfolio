# SQL

SQL practice queries will be added to this folder.

- AI prompts are used instead of queries from real databases to enforce memory and obtain instant feedback on mistakes and suggestions
- Copilot is being used (as of 2/1/2026) as the primary AI for training purposes

I understand that most modern Data Analysts use AIs to write queries, which I will be doing in the future, but I would like complete mastery of all SQL functions to be able to perform these tasks without the use of AI if needed.
