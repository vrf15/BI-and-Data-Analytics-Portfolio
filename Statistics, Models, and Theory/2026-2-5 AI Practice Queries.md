## Question 19
A hospital wants to know whether the **proportion of patients who miss their follow‑up appointment** differs across **three age groups** (Under 40, 40–64, 65+).

### My Answer
B — ANOVA

### Correct Answer
C — Chi‑Square

### Explanation
The outcome — **missed follow‑up appointment** — is **Yes/No**, which is categorical.  
The predictor — **age group** — is also categorical (three buckets).  

Whenever both variables are categorical, the correct test is **Chi‑Square**, regardless of how many groups the predictor has.  
ANOVA only applies when the **outcome is continuous**, which is not the case here.

### Key Pattern
Categorical outcome + Categorical predictor → **Chi‑Square**

## Question 20
A hospital wants to know whether **average time to pain medication** (in minutes) differs between **patients who arrived by EMS**, **patients who walked in**, and **patients transferred from another facility**.

### My Answer
B — Correlation

### Correct Answer
D — ANOVA

### Explanation
The predictor — **arrival method** — is **categorical with 3 groups** (EMS, Walk‑In, Transfer).  
The outcome — **time to pain medication** — is **continuous** (minutes).  

This is the classic structure for **ANOVA**, which compares mean values across 3 or more groups.  
Correlation only applies when **both variables are continuous**, which is not the case here.

### Key Pattern
3+ groups (categorical) → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

## Question 21
A hospital wants to know whether **average lab turnaround time** (continuous) differs across **STAT**, **Urgent**, and **Routine** orders (categorical), *and* whether **turnaround time is related to patient age** (continuous).  
You have NOT learned regression or interaction models.

### My Answer
D — Both A and B (run separately)

### Correct Answer
D — Both A and B (run separately)

### Explanation
There are **two separate questions**, each requiring a different test:

1. **Does average turnaround time differ across STAT/Urgent/Routine?**  
   - Predictor: categorical (3 groups)  
   - Outcome: continuous  
   → **ANOVA**

2. **Is turnaround time related to patient age?**  
   - Continuous ↔ Continuous  
   → **Correlation**

Because regression and interaction terms are not part of your current four‑test universe, the correct approach is to run **ANOVA and Correlation separately**.

### Key Pattern
Multiple questions → **Run multiple tests**  
3+ groups → **ANOVA**  
Continuous ↔ Continuous → **Correlation**

## Question 22
A hospital wants to know whether the **proportion of patients who develop a postoperative complication** differs across **four surgeons**, and whether **complication rate** is related to **surgery duration** (minutes).  
You are restricted to the four‑test universe (T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, Correlation).

### My Answer
C — Correlation

### Correct Answer
D — Both A and C (run separately)

### Explanation
There are **two different questions**, each requiring a different test:

1. **Do complication rates differ across four surgeons?**  
   - Complication = Yes/No (categorical)  
   - Surgeon = 4 groups (categorical)  
   → **Chi‑Square**

2. **Is complication rate related to surgery duration?**  
   - Complication = Yes/No (categorical)  
   - Duration = continuous  
   → Within the four‑test universe, the only valid option is to treat this as:  
     **Categorical ↔ Continuous → Correlation (imperfect but allowed under constraints)**

Because regression/logistic models are not available yet, the correct approach is to run **Chi‑Square** for the group comparison and **Correlation** for the continuous relationship.

### Key Pattern
Multiple questions → **Multiple tests**  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**  
Categorical ↔ Continuous (within constraints) → **Correlation**

## Question 23
A hospital wants to know whether **average number of daily discharges** (continuous) differs across **three months** (January, February, March — categorical), and whether **daily discharges** are related to **average daily census** (continuous).  
You are restricted to the four‑test universe (T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, Correlation).

### My Answer
C — Both A and B (run separately)

### Correct Answer
C — Both A and B (run separately)

### Explanation
There are **two distinct analytical questions**, each requiring a different test:

1. **Do average daily discharges differ across January, February, and March?**  
   - Predictor: Month (categorical, 3 groups)  
   - Outcome: Daily discharges (continuous)  
   → **ANOVA**

2. **Are daily discharges related to average daily census?**  
   - Continuous ↔ Continuous  
   → **Correlation**

Because regression and time‑series models are not part of your current toolbox, the correct approach is to run **ANOVA** and **Correlation** as two separate analyses.

### Key Pattern
Multiple questions → **Multiple tests**  
3+ groups → **ANOVA**  
Continuous ↔ Continuous → **Correlation**

## Question 24
A hospital wants to know whether **average patient satisfaction score** differs across **three appointment types** (New Patient, Follow‑Up, Post‑Op).  
The satisfaction score is recorded as **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**, but these values represent **ordered categories**, not a true continuous scale.

### My Answer
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer
A — ANOVA

### Explanation
Even though the satisfaction score is technically **ordinal**, you are restricted to the four‑test universe.  
Within that constraint, ANOVA is still the correct choice because:

- The predictor is **categorical with 3 groups**  
- The outcome is **numeric**, even if not perfectly continuous  
- None of the other tests fit the structure  

In real analytics work, you might use a non‑parametric alternative (like Kruskal‑Wallis), but that is outside the current allowed test set.

### Key Pattern
3+ groups → Numeric outcome → **ANOVA**  
(Ordinal treated as numeric within the four‑test framework)

## Question 25
A hospital wants to know whether the **average number of medications administered per patient** (a count treated as continuous) differs across **four inpatient units** (Med‑Surg, ICU, Telemetry, Orthopedics).

### My Answer
C — T‑Test

### Correct Answer
B — ANOVA

### Explanation
The predictor — **inpatient unit** — has **four groups**, which automatically rules out a T‑Test (only used for two groups).  
The outcome — **number of medications** — is a **count**, but in analytics counts are treated as **continuous** unless explicitly bucketed.  

So the structure is:
- 4 groups (categorical)  
- continuous outcome (count treated as numeric)  

This is the classic signature of **ANOVA**.

### Key Pattern
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

# Format‑5 Drill — Advanced Set 3
## Question 26
A hospital wants to know whether **average length of stay (LOS)** differs across **three discharge dispositions** (Home, SNF, Rehab).  
However, LOS is recorded as **“Short”, “Medium”, “Long”**, later mapped to **1, 2, 3** — but these are **ordinal categories**, not true continuous LOS.

### My Answer
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer
B — Chi‑Square

### Explanation
Even though LOS was mapped to numbers (1, 2, 3), those numbers **do not represent real continuous values**.  
They are simply labels for **ordered categories**:

- Short  
- Medium  
- Long  

The predictor (discharge disposition) is also **categorical with 3 groups**.

So the structure is:

- Categorical outcome (ordinal disguised as numeric)  
- Categorical predictor (3 groups)  

This is **categorical ↔ categorical**, which means:

→ **Chi‑Square** is the correct test.

ANOVA requires a **continuous** outcome, which is not the case here.

### Key Pattern
If a variable is numeric but represents **labels**, not measurements → treat it as **categorical** → **Chi‑Square**

# Format‑5 Drill — Advanced Set 3
## Question 27
A hospital wants to know whether the **proportion of patients who return to the ED within 72 hours** differs across **three LOS buckets** (<2 days, 2–4 days, >4 days).  
LOS was originally continuous but has been **bucketed into categories**.

### My Answer
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer
B — Chi‑Square

### Explanation
Once LOS is **bucketed**, it stops being continuous and becomes **categorical**.  
The outcome — **ED return within 72 hours** — is also categorical (Yes/No).

So the structure becomes:

- Predictor: **Categorical (3 LOS buckets)**  
- Outcome: **Categorical (return vs. no return)**  

Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**

ANOVA requires a **continuous** outcome, which is not present here.

### Key Pattern
If a continuous variable is **bucketed**, it becomes categorical → **Chi‑Square** for categorical outcomes.

## Question 28
A hospital wants to know whether **average surgery duration** (continuous) differs across **three surgeons** (categorical), and whether **surgery duration** is related to **patient BMI** (continuous).  
You are restricted to the four‑test universe (T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, Correlation).

### My Answer
C — Both A and B (run separately)

### Correct Answer
C — Both A and B (run separately)

### Explanation
Two distinct questions

# Format‑5 Drill — Advanced Set 3
## Question 29
A hospital wants to know whether **average patient age** (continuous) differs between patients who **were readmitted within 30 days** and those who **were not**.  
Readmission is coded as **0 = No, 1 = Yes**, which is **binary categorical**, not continuous.

### My Answer
A — Chi‑Square

### Correct Answer
B — T‑Test

### Explanation
The structure is:

- Predictor: **Readmission (0/1)** → binary categorical  
- Outcome: **Age** → continuous  

This is the classic signature of a **T‑Test**:

**Two groups → Continuous outcome → T‑Test**

Chi‑Square is only used when **both** variables are categorical.  
Here, age is continuous, so Chi‑Square is not appropriate.

### Key Pattern
Binary categorical ↔ Continuous → **T‑Test**

# Format‑5 Drill — Advanced Set 3
## Question 30
A hospital wants to know whether the **proportion of patients who miss their follow‑up appointment** differs across **three insurance types** (Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid).  
Insurance types were coded as **1, 2, 3**, but these are **labels**, not real numeric values.

### My Answer
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer
B — Chi‑Square

### Explanation
The structure is:

- Predictor: **Insurance type (1, 2, 3)** → categorical  
- Outcome: **Missed follow‑up (Yes/No)** → categorical  

This is **categorical ↔ categorical**, which means:

→ **Chi‑Square** is the correct test.

ANOVA requires a **continuous** outcome.  
Here, the outcome is a **proportion**, which is fundamentally categorical (missed vs. not missed).

### Key Pattern
Numeric labels ≠ continuous data  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**
