## Focus: Statistical Test Selection & Variable Classification (Four‑Test Universe)

Today’s practice session focuses on **correctly identifying variable types** (continuous vs categorical) and selecting the appropriate statistical test within the **four‑test framework**:

- **T‑Test**  
- **ANOVA**  
- **Chi‑Square**  
- **Correlation**

The emphasis is on **pattern recognition**, **avoiding traps**, and **building instinctive classification skills** used in real healthcare and operational analytics.

### Practice Method
- Copilot provides scenario‑based prompts  
- I classify variables and select the correct statistical test  
- Immediate feedback is reviewed and incorporated  
- Patterns are reinforced through progressive difficulty  

### Goals
- Strengthen mastery of continuous vs categorical variable identification  
- Correctly map scenarios to T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, or Correlation  
- Build rapid pattern recognition for real‑world BI and clinical analytics  
- Avoid misclassification traps  
- Maintain clarity and consistency across all reasoning steps

# **QUESTION 1**
A hospital wants to know whether **insurance type** (Medicare, Medicaid, Commercial) is related to **readmission status** (Yes/No).

### My Answer  
C

### Correct Answer  
C — Chi‑Square

### Explanation  
Both variables are **categorical**, so the correct test is Chi‑Square. It evaluates whether the distribution of readmissions differs across insurance types.

### Key Pattern  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**

---

# **QUESTION 2**
A Revenue Integrity analyst wants to compare the **average charge per visit** between **Clinic A** and **Clinic B**.

### My Answer  
B

### Correct Answer  
B — T‑Test

### Explanation  
Two groups (Clinic A vs Clinic B) and a continuous outcome (charge per visit) form the classic T‑Test structure.

### Key Pattern  
Two groups → Continuous outcome → **T‑Test**

---

# **QUESTION 3**
A healthcare operations analyst wants to know whether **patient age** is related to **length of stay**.

### My Answer  
B — specifically Pearson

### Correct Answer  
B — Correlation (Pearson)

### Explanation  
Both variables are continuous. Pearson correlation is appropriate when assessing a linear relationship between two continuous measures.

### Key Pattern  
Continuous ↔ Continuous → **Correlation**

---

# **QUESTION 4**
Finance wants to compare the **average cost per case** across **four departments**.

### My Answer  
C — ANOVA

### Correct Answer  
C — ANOVA

### Explanation  
A categorical predictor with 3+ groups and a continuous outcome requires ANOVA to compare group means.

### Key Pattern  
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

---

# **QUESTION 5**
A quality improvement team wants to know whether **average wait time** differs across **three shifts**.

### My Answer  
B — ANOVA

### Correct Answer  
B — ANOVA

### Explanation  
Three shifts = 3 groups. Wait time is continuous. ANOVA is the correct test for comparing multiple group means.

### Key Pattern  
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

---

# **QUESTION 6**
A hospital wants to know whether **denial category** is related to **payer type**.

### My Answer  
B — Correlation

### Correct Answer  
C — Chi‑Square

### Explanation  
Both variables are categorical. Correlation only applies to numeric variables, so Chi‑Square is the correct test.

### Key Pattern  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**

---

# **QUESTION 7**
A hospital wants to know whether **average LOS** differs between **new care pathway** vs **standard pathway**.

### My Answer  
A — Chi‑Square

### Correct Answer  
C — T‑Test

### Explanation  
Two groups (new vs standard) and a continuous outcome (LOS) require a T‑Test. Chi‑Square would only apply if LOS were categorical.

### Key Pattern  
Two groups → Continuous outcome → **T‑Test**

---

# **QUESTION 8**
A data analyst wants to know whether **staffing level** is related to **lab turnaround time**.

### My Answer  
D — Chi‑Square

### Correct Answer  
C — Correlation

### Explanation  
Both variables are continuous. Correlation is used to measure the strength and direction of their relationship.

### Key Pattern  
Continuous ↔ Continuous → **Correlation**

---

# **QUESTION 9**
A clinical researcher wants to know whether **pain score** is related to **mobility score**.

### My Answer  
C — Spearman

### Correct Answer  
C — Correlation (Spearman acceptable)

### Explanation  
Both variables are continuous. Spearman is appropriate when the relationship may be monotonic but not strictly linear or normally distributed.

### Key Pattern  
Continuous ↔ Continuous → **Correlation**

---

# **QUESTION 10**
A population health analyst wants to know whether **smoking status** is related to **readmission status**.

### My Answer  
D — Chi‑Square

### Correct Answer  
D — Chi‑Square

### Explanation  
Both variables are categorical. Chi‑Square tests whether readmission rates differ between smokers and non‑smokers.

### Key Pattern  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**

---

# **QUESTION 11**
A hospital wants to know whether the **relationship between age and blood pressure** differs for **males vs females**.

### My Answer  
A — Run two separate correlations

### Correct Answer  
A — Run two separate correlations

### Explanation  
Within the four‑test universe, the only valid approach is to run separate correlations by subgroup and compare the strength/direction of the relationships.

### Key Pattern  
Comparing relationships across groups → **Separate correlations**

---

# **QUESTION 12**
A hospital wants to know whether **average satisfaction score** differs across **four clinic locations**, even though scores are skewed.

### My Answer  
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer  
A — ANOVA

### Explanation  
Even with skewed data, the correct test within the four‑test framework is ANOVA because the predictor has 3+ groups and the outcome is continuous.

### Key Pattern  
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

---

# **QUESTION 13**
A hospital wants to compare **average patient satisfaction** across **three service lines**.

### My Answer  
A — T‑Test

### Correct Answer  
B — ANOVA

### Explanation  
Three groups require ANOVA, not a T‑Test. T‑Tests only compare two groups.

### Key Pattern  
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

---

# **QUESTION 14**
A clinic wants to know whether **average wait time** differs by **day of week** (7 groups).

### My Answer  
A — ANOVA

### Correct Answer  
A — ANOVA

### Explanation  
Seven groups and a continuous outcome make this a straightforward ANOVA scenario.

### Key Pattern  
3+ groups → Continuous outcome → **ANOVA**

---

# **QUESTION 15**
A quality team wants to know whether the **proportion of patients** receiving timely pain reassessment differs across **five units**.

### My Answer  
B — ANOVA

### Correct Answer  
C — Chi‑Square

### Explanation  
Both variables are categorical (unit + yes/no outcome). Chi‑Square is the correct test for comparing proportions across groups.

### Key Pattern  
Categorical ↔ Categorical → **Chi‑Square**

---

# **QUESTION 16**
A hospital wants to know whether **average LOS** differs between **readmitted vs not readmitted** patients.

### My Answer  
A — T‑Test

### Correct Answer  
A — T‑Test

### Explanation  
Two groups and a continuous outcome → T‑Test.

### Key Pattern  
Two groups → Continuous outcome → **T‑Test**

# **QUESTION 17**
A surgical director wants to know whether **infection rate** differs across **three procedure types**.

### My Answer  
C — Chi‑Square

### Correct Answer  
C — Chi‑Square

### Explanation  
Infection status is categorical. Procedure type is categorical. Chi‑Square evaluates whether infection rates differ across groups.

### My Answer  
D — Correlation

### Correct Answer  
D — Correlation

### Explanation
