## Focus: Statistical Test Selection & Variable Classification (Four‑Test Universe)

Today’s practice session centers on **correctly identifying variable types** (continuous vs categorical) and selecting the appropriate statistical test within the **four‑test framework** (T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, Correlation).  
The emphasis is on **pattern recognition**, **categorical/continuous classification**, and **avoiding common traps** that appear in real hospital analytics.

### Practice Method
- Copilot provides scenario‑based prompts  
- I classify variables and select the correct statistical test  
- Immediate feedback is reviewed and incorporated  
- Patterns are reinforced through progressive difficulty

### Goals
- Strengthen mastery of continuous vs categorical variable identification  
- Correctly map scenarios to T‑Test, ANOVA, Chi‑Square, or Correlation  
- Build rapid pattern recognition for real‑world BI and clinical analytics  
- Avoid misclassification traps (e.g., skewed data, small samples, multi‑group predictors)  
- Maintain clarity and consistency across all reasoning steps
