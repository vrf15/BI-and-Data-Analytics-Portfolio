# Data Engineering & Analytics Foundations Project

## Overview
This repository documents a structured introduction to analytics engineering and data engineering concepts using the Superstore dataset. The workflow mirrors enterprise practices, including staging, metric extraction, dimensional analysis, and disciplined documentation.

The purpose of this project is to build a repeatable, professional analytics engineering process while strengthening SQL, analytical reasoning, and data modeling fundamentals.

## AI Usage Note

NOTE: This project intentionally incorporates AI‑assisted development (Copilot, ChatGPT)
      to reflect current industry practices. I already have foundational skills in SQL
      (reading, diagnosing, and writing queries) and basic Python proficiency.
   
      In enterprise environments—especially those involving sensitive or regulated data
      such as HIPAA—AI usage must follow strict privacy and compliance requirements.
      For this reason, future workflows will incorporate offline, non‑telemetry models

## Objectives
- Establish a clean, enterprise‑grade SQL workflow.
- Build a structured notes system for analysis.
- Extract core business metrics from a staging table.
- Begin dimensional analysis (category, region, segment).
- Develop habits aligned with analytics engineering best practices.
