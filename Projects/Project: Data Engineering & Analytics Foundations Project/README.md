# Data Engineering & Analytics Foundations Project

## Overview
This repository documents a structured introduction to analytics engineering and data engineering concepts using the Superstore dataset. The workflow mirrors enterprise practices, including staging, metric extraction, dimensional analysis, and disciplined documentation.

The purpose of this project is to build a repeatable, professional analytics engineering process while strengthening SQL, analytical reasoning, and data modeling fundamentals.

NOTE: This project intentionally incorporates AI‑assisted development (Copilot, ChatGPT)
      to reflect current industry practices. I already have foundational skills in SQL
      (reading, diagnosing, and writing queries) and basic Python proficiency.
   
      In enterprise environments—especially those involving sensitive or regulated data
      such as HIPAA—AI usage must follow strict privacy and compliance requirements.
      For this reason, future workflows will incorporate offline, non‑telemetry models

## Objectives
- Establish a clean, enterprise‑grade SQL workflow.
- Build a structured notes system for analysis.
- Extract core business metrics from a staging table.
- Begin dimensional analysis (category, region, segment).
- Develop habits aligned with analytics engineering best practices.

## Dataset
**Source:** `staging.superstore`  
A retail dataset containing orders, customers, products, and regional information.

## Tools Used in This Project

This project utilizes a combination of SQL, analytics engineering practices, and AI‑assisted development. The following tools support the workflow:

- **DBeaver** — SQL client used for querying, notes, and workflow organization.
- **PostgreSQL (or equivalent SQL engine)** — backend for executing queries against the Superstore dataset.
- **GitHub** — version control and documentation repository.
- **Copilot / ChatGPT** — AI‑assisted development for SQL generation, workflow structuring, and process guidance.
- **Offline AI Models (e.g., Phi‑3)** — planned for future stages involving sensitive or regulated data.
