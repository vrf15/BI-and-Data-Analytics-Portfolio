## Focus: Python Fundamentals (Functions, Classification, Derived Metrics)

Today’s practice session reinforces **core Python fundamentals**, emphasizing repeated exposure to functions, conditionals, list‑of‑dictionary processing, and derived metric calculations. The goal is to build automaticity through structured repetition, mirroring the disciplined workflow used in SQL drills.

Each exercise incrementally increases complexity while maintaining clarity, correctness, and production‑quality structure.

### Practice Method
- Copilot provides Python prompts  
- I write the full solution using clean formatting and best practices  
- Immediate feedback is reviewed and incorporated  
- Format 5 is used to maintain consistency and reinforce muscle memory  

### Goals
- Strengthen mastery of Python functions and conditional logic  
- Practice looping through lists of dictionaries and adding new fields  
- Build confidence with derived metrics (e.g., pulse pressure)  
- Maintain clean, readable, BI‑ready code structure  
- Reinforce repetition of the same concepts before moving on to advanced topics
