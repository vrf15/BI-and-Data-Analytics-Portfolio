# Data Analytics & Analytics Engineering Portfolio

Hello, my name is **Vincent F**, and this repository documents my progression from foundational data analytics into **analytics engineering and data engineering**. Since starting this journey, I’ve expanded far beyond SQL and BI dashboards — I’m now building **end‑to‑end data pipelines**, practicing **ETL/ELT**, and designing **professional data models** using real engineering patterns.

I am also building a compact **home data engineering stack** (PostgreSQL, Linux, Docker, Airflow/Prefect, MinIO, dbt‑style modeling) so I can practice the full lifecycle of modern data workflows and architect my own miniature data warehouse.

This repository now includes:

- **Daily SQL and Python practice**
- **Exploratory analysis and business logic development**
- **Power BI dashboards**
- **A full analytics engineering project**, including RAW → STAGING → CORE modeling
- **Star Schema design (fact + dimension tables)**
- **Documentation, notes, and changelogs following enterprise conventions**

The goal is to demonstrate not only technical skill, but also **my commitment to mastering the full analytics engineering pipeline**.

## Repository Structure

As of **February 2026**, this repository includes:

### **SQL/**
- Query practice  
- CTEs, joins, window functions  
- Analytical SQL exercises  
- Data modeling and transformation logic  

### **Python/**
WIP

### **BI_Dashboards/**
WIP

### **Data_Engineering_Project/**
*(New since January 2026)*  
- RAW schema ingestion  
- STAGING schema cleaning and standardization  
- CORE schema (dbt‑style) star schema  
- Fact and dimension table design  
- Notes, changelogs, and modeling documentation

## Tools & Skills

- SQL (analytics + modeling)  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, automation)  
- Power BI  
- Excel  
- Data Modeling (Star Schema, fact/dim design)  
- ETL/ELT workflows  
- Schema design (RAW → STAGING → CORE → ANALYTICS)
