# Data Analytics and Data Engineering Portfolio

Hello, my name is **Vincent F**, and this repository documents my **data analytics learning and project portfolio**. I will also be adding on **data engineering and architecture** projects later on. I am currently thinking of creating a compact stack at home so I can practice the ETL/ELT process and create organized schemas within my very own minitiaure data warehouse.

This repository includes my full progression in data analytics — from **daily SQL and Python practice** to **completed Power BI dashboards and analytical projects**. The goal is to demonstrate not only technical skills, but also **how willing I am to learn more about the field and broaden my scope!**

## Repository Structure

As of **January 31, 2026**, this repository is organized into three main folders:

- **SQL** — Query practice, CTEs, joins, and analytical SQL projects  
- **Python** — Data cleaning, analysis, and exploratory workflows using Pandas  
- **BI_Dashboards** — Power BI dashboards with documented business questions, KPIs, and insights

Each folder contains README files that explain the purpose of the work and the skills being practiced.

## Tools & Skills
- SQL
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, visualization)
- Power BI
- Excel

This repository will continue to evolve as I develop more advanced projects and dashboards.
