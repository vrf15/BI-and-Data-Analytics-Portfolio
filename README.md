# Data Analytics and Engineering Portfolio

Hello, my name is Vincent, and I am in a graduate program in data analytics, although I am very interested in data engineering as well.


## Active Projects

### Project 1: Social Media Trends & Amazon Sales Correlation
Capture data from social media trends and historical measures of Amazon sales. I am trying to figure out how social media trends can correlate with sales spikes and if we can accurately predict them before they happen. This is highly applicable in my friends' business.

### Project 2: Creator Vault Risk Assessment Index
Capture data from vault creators and create a robust risk assessment index based on historical data. My other friend is a software developer and is currently working on a public site that tests vaults and smart contracts.

## Engineering Roadmap
As of right now, both projects will be housed in my laptop's DB, but I am planning on converting my old pc into a linux server. I am going to incorporate Airflow, Airbyte, Docker, dbt, and a multitude of other programs in my process. 

My main goal is to see what works, what can be optimized, and to get a stable and efficient ETL process that is fully automated. It will be really unoptimized at first, but I will update the repo as I go (or whenever I can).

### Tech Stack
| Category | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stack** | PowerBI, PostgreSQL, DBeaver, dbt |
| **Upcoming** | Airflow, Docker, Airbyte |

## Repository Structure

* **/BI Dashboards**: Visualizations and reporting.
* **/Projects**: Core logic and pipeline code.
* **/Python**: Archive of Python exercises and AI-quizzed logic.
* **/SQL**: Historical SQL scripts and queries.
* **/Statistics, Models, Theory**: Theoretical foundations and model notes.

> **Note:** The Python, SQL, and Statistics folders are honestly pretty dated. I've learned a lot since then, but I had AI quiz me on Python and SQL before I started using them in tools.

## AI Usage & Ethics

### AI Disclaimer
I don't put any sensitive data in AI. If I need help with any sort of data-related tasks, I will return all the column names, describe the shape to AI, or provide any other pertinent characteristics, but not anything important. I work in healthcare right now and I know better than just dumping sensitive information where it doesn't belong. I am not stupid. This extends to any personal data that could get me in trouble. Simply put, I don't put actual files in AI or sensitive information. I describe what I need.

### AI Assistants
* **Gemini:** I use this AI to plan. Pretty solid for mapping everything out.
* **Claude:** I used this model 100% for really tough coding or analytics.
* **ChatGPT:** Good ol' reliable ChatGPT. I use this AI when I need a third AI for whatever reason (which is rare).
* **Copilot:** Used to use Copilot a lot for quizzing myself and GitHub formatting. Maybe I'll start using this more with VSS, but I prefer other AIs.
